# Cubic Bézier Curve Visualization and Animation

This project provides an interactive cubic Bézier curve implementation where users can adjust control points similar to those found in After Effects.

## Features

- **Dynamic Control Points**: Drag and move control points to reshape the curve.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: The curve updates dynamically as you adjust control points.
- **Animation**: A box animates along the curve to demonstrate its progression.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhaanurag/Vanilla-JS-Custom-Bezier-Curve.git
   cd Vanilla-JS-Custom-Bezier-Curve
  \
2. Open index.html in your browser to view the project.
## How It Works
1. Control Points: Dragging control points updates their coordinates in real-time.
2. Curve Calculation: The cubic Bézier curve is rendered dynamically using an SVG <path> and recalculated based on the control points.
3. Animation: A box moves along the curve, demonstrating how the curve influences motion.
Enjoy exploring cubic Bézier curves!
